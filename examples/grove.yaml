    title: "A meadow in the forest"
    desc: >
      You stand in the middle of a small meadow, surrounded by large oak trees
      on all sides.  The air is cool and damp, and a fog hangs over the woods around you.
      Other than the occasional cry of a raven, the forest is quiet, and you wonder
      if the crackle of twigs and leaves under your footsteps might draw attention.
      A path leads north into the woods.

    title: "A path among oak trees"
    desc: >
      "You walk along a path between oak trees.  The trail is well worn
      but the forest off the beaten path is wild and overgrown with moss and nettles.
      You see a small clearing to the north, while to the south, the trail leads out 
      toward a meadow."

    title: A cabin
    desc: >
      "You arrive at a small clearing with a log cabin to the east. You see a thin
      wisp of smoke rising from the chimney. A crude fence outlines a simple garden,
      but you don't see anything growing. The path leads back into the woods to the north
      and south."
